# GCDSwift

GCDSwift is a quick (as in day-of-release) Swift port of [GCDObjC](https://github.com/mjmsmith/gcdobjc/), which is an Objective-C wrapper for the most commonly used features of Grand Central Dispatch.  

I did this mainly as a learning exercise to compare a simple library written in the two languages.  As GCDObjC delegates most of its functionality to the underlying Grand Central Dispatch C library, it's also a good example of Swift's C binding support (which is much better than I expected).
